      text: `It's the end of Autumn, and you and your twin brother Alex are riding your bikes home from school. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the road. You're pedalling your bike, feeling the cool wind against your face. 
      
      Up ahead, an old mansion stands tall and foreboding. Its darkened windows seem to stare back at you, and the twisted trees surrounding it add to its eerie charm. For as long as you can remember, it's been the subject of countless rumours and ghost stories. But you've never seen anyone go in or out of it. It's been abandoned for years, and you've always wondered what secrets it holds.

      Any other day, you'd have ignored it and gone home. But today, something about the mansion seems different. The air feels charged, almost electric, and you can't shake off the feeling that something is about to happen. Almost against your will, you find yourself slowing down, your bike coming to a stop. Alex stops beside you, his curious gaze mirroring your own.`,

    "Bet you wouldn't ring the doorbell," he teases.

    "Oh, grow up" you snap, unable to pull your gaze from the mansion. 

    Without waiting for your response, Alex speeds up, his bike coming to a halt right in front of the mansion's entrance. He hops off, marches up the steps, and impulsively presses the doorbell. The chime echoes eerily, and after a tense and silent minute... nothing happens. 
    
    Alex turns to you, a smug grin on his face. "See? Nothing to be afraid of. I bet it's not even locked." 

    He reaches for the door handle, and it swings open with a loud creak. You stare at him, wide-eyed. "Are you crazy? We can't just go in there!"

    "Who would know? Besides, it's not like we're stealing anything. We're just looking around. Now, are you coming or not?"
    
    Do you follow Alex into the abandoned mansion? Or do you call it quits and head home?`,

      The main hall is expansive, with a grand staircase leading to the upper floors. On either side, there are doors leading to various rooms, their dark wooden frames intricately carved with designs that seem to move if you stare too long.
      
      The floor, made of polished marble, reflects the candlelight, and the walls are adorned with faded portraits of people who must've lived here ages ago. Their stern expressions make you uneasy, and you can't shake off the feeling that they're watching you.
      
      As you're taking in the surroundings, a soft humming sound reaches your ears. It's distant, almost melodic, and seems to be coming from a corridor to your left.
      
      To your right, there's a shadowed door revealing a glimpse of a vast library. Rows upon rows of shelves filled with ancient books, their spines worn out from time. A soft glow emanates from the room, likely from a fireplace, casting a warm, inviting light.
      
      Torn between the two, you hesitate. Do you follow the mysterious humming? Or do you investigate the library, hoping to find answers among the old tomes?

      "Suit yourself! I'm going in!". 
      
      You keep walking, hoping to call his bluff, but when you glance back he's nowhere to be seen. Rolling your eyes, you wait a few seconds... then a few more. But he doesn't reappear.

      You and Alex head towards the door and step into the vast library. Rows upon rows of ancient books line the shelves, their spines worn and faded from time. The room is warmly lit by a fireplace, casting dancing shadows on the walls. But what immediately catches your attention is a single book displayed on a pedestal in the centre of the room.
      
      Approaching it, you see that the book is ancient, its pages yellowed and fragile. It's open to a particular page, and a passage is highlighted with a strange, glowing ink. The book's binding, however, is even more intriguing. It's made of an unfamiliar material, dark and leathery, with an odd texture that seems almost... alive.
      
      Alex leans in closer, squinting at the highlighted passage. "This looks important. Should we read it?"
      
      You hesitate, torn between the mysterious passage and the book's peculiar binding. "I don't know... Something about that binding gives me the creeps."
      
      Alex nods in agreement. "Yeah, it's definitely weird. But that passage... it might tell us something about this place."
      
      Now faced with another decision, do you choose to read the glowing passage out loud, hoping it provides answers? Or do you investigate the strange material of the book's binding, looking for clues about its origins?

      "Yeah," you reply, listening intently. "It's... strange, isn't it?"
      
      Alex nods. "Wanna check it out? Could be a clue about this place."
      
      You hesitate for a moment, glancing towards the inviting library. "I don't know... The library seems safer."
      
      Alex grins, a spark in his eyes. "Come on, Susie. Where's your sense of adventure? Besides, it might just be the radio or something."
      
      You roll your eyes but can't help but smile. "Alright, alright. Let's follow the humming. But if we get into trouble, I'm blaming you."
      
      Alex winks. "Deal."
      
      With that, the two of you cautiously make your way towards the source of the humming, the sound growing louder with each step.

    As you and Alex continue down the corridor, the humming becomes more pronounced, echoing through the cold, draughty halls. But just as you're getting lost in its hypnotic rhythm, a swift movement catches your eye. A shadow, fleeting and elusive, darts into a room just off the corridor.
      
      Alex, noticing your distraction, follows your gaze. "Did you see that?" he asks, a hint of trepidation in his voice.
      
      You nod, heart racing. "Yeah. A shadow... or something. It went into that room."
      
      He glances at the door, then back at you, torn. "What do you think? Should we check it out, or stick to the humming?"
      
      You pause, weighing the options. On one hand, the shadow could be a clue, or perhaps someone who can help. On the other, the humming has an almost magnetic pull, beckoning you forward.
      
      "It might be nothing," you muse, "but what if it's important? Then again, the humming..."
      
      "Your call, Susie."
      
      Now faced with a decision, do you choose to investigate the mysterious shadow, or do you continue on, drawn by the humming?

      Your vision blurs and you feel yourself being pushed to the back of your own mind, a dark presence taking over. A demonic entity, awakened by the words you read, now possesses your body. An insatiable hunger consumes every fiber of your being.
      
      Your mouth stretches impossibly wide, revealing countless rows of sharp, jagged teeth. Alex, horror evident in his eyes, stammers, "Susie? What... What have you done?"
      
      But there's no Susie anymore. Only the demon and its hunger.
      
      With a swift, ravenous movement, you close the distance between you and Alex. His screams echo in the room, but are quickly silenced.
      
      The mansion, with its countless mysteries and shadows, now has a new, malevolent denizen. And within you, where Susie once stood, there remains only an endless, insatiable hunger.

      Your heart races, and a cold dread settles in your stomach. "Alex," you whisper, pulling your hand back as if burned, "This... this is skin."
      
      But there's no reply. You glance around, searching for your sibling. "Alex?" you call out, your voice trembling.
      
      He seems to have wandered deeper into the library, perhaps looking for another exit. You're about to call out to him again when suddenly, a strong hand covers your mouth from behind, stifling your scream. Panic surges through you as you try to struggle, but the grip is too strong, and darkness quickly envelops you as you succumb to unconsciousness.
      
      The last thing you remember is the faint scent of old books and the cold touch of the leather-bound tome.

The room appears to be an old study, with a large oak desk in the center and bookshelves lining the walls. But what captures your attention is the shadow on the floor.
      
      There's no discernible source for it. No person, no object casting it. Yet, there it is, dark and ominous. Before you can process this, the shadow starts to grow, stretching and distorting. It looms larger, taking on a more menacing form as it advances toward you.
      
      Alex's eyes widen in alarm. "What the...?"
      
      You take a step back, heart pounding in your chest.

    Desperation fuels your steps, but it's in vain. The shadow catches up, and you feel the same coldness that took Alex start to seep into you. It begins at your feet, climbing, consuming, until darkness takes over.
